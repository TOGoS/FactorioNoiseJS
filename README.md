This repo provides some javascript code that implements
Factorio's random number generator, basis noise function, and multioctave noise function
in JavaScript.

- Run the RNG tests: ```node 20190305-noise-reproduction.js```
- Run the noise function tests: ```node 20190325-noise.js```

Sorry about the nonsensical script names.
